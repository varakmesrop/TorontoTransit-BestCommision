I, Varak commute everyday to university, and one of the problems I have is, if I should get the monthly TTC pass 
or continue filling my presto card, with 'pay-as-you-go' price, that is why I made this program to help you and I decide 
which one we should invest in to save money. I am using the TTC website for all the price and age information
The program asks for a name, age, and how frequently the person will be using the TTC (The Toronto Transit Commission) in a month.
Then the program will ask if they want to add another person. The program continues until user tells it to stop.
The results of all the people will be outputed on a file.
