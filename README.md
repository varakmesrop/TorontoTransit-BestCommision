I am a frequent commuter, so I need to know what is the best deal for me to save money.
The program asks for a name, age, and how frequently the person will be using the TTC (The Toronto Transit Commission) in a month.
Then the program will ask if they want to add another person. The program continues until user tells it to stop.
The results of all the people will be outputed on a file.
